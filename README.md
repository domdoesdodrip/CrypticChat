## 📖 Usage Protocol (Tutorial)

### 1. Identity Creation
Your **Name** is public to all users in the room. 
* **Limit:** 20 Characters.
* **Advice:** Use a nickname. This network is designed for anonymity.

### 2. Frequency (Room) Selection
The **Room ID** determines which encrypted sub-channel you enter.
* **Global Access:** Leave the Room ID blank to enter the public lobby.
* **Private Frequency:** Enter a specific word and numbers (e.g., `EXAMPLE123`) to create a hidden room. 
* **Crucial:** Only users with the *exact* same Room ID can see your messages.

### 3. Connection States
* **Hanging/Slow Load:** If the "Join" button spins, the cloud-hosted backend is waking up. Give it 15-30 seconds.
* **Active Nodes:** Once inside, check the sidebar. It displays how many "nodes" (users) are currently active on your frequency.

### 4. Secure Termination
To leave the network, click **DISCONNECT**. 
> **Warning:** Closing the browser tab without clicking disconnect may leave a "ghost" session active in the room for up to 30 seconds.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**"I can't see my friend's messages!"**
1. Check that you both spelled the **Room ID** exactly the same (it is case-sensitive).
2. Ensure you both have a stable internet connection.

**"The site won't load!"**
Ensure you are using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari). Internet Explorer is not supported.
